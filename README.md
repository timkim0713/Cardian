# Problem Statement
```
  Team ZeroClass presents FMS based Emergency Assistant Matching Service, CARDIAN. Our team defines 
"Mobility Barrier" as Disconnection between vehicles and pedestrians who are exposed to unpredictable 
events such as sudden medical problems or potential crimes.

  Specifically, we have found out that the majority of women are feeling threatened at night out in the 
street, which causes psychological anxiety. In another case, there are emergency happenings resolved 
by people nearby. Our question is, How can we solve these problems more effiectively?

  At this time, there are existing mobile applications that help those in danger, such as "Smart Emergency
Alert" app. However, this app is only limited to alert their guardians.
 
  As an ideal solution, Our Team implemented AutoCrypt's FMS Data to locate the vehicles' locations and V2X
Technology in order to connect the vehicle and the pedstrian. Our service, CARDIAN, is an FMS based Emergency
Assistant Matching mobile application that makes V2P connection. This way, CARDIAN recues emergency patients,
reduces psychological anxieties, and further improves civic consciousness in our society.

  Our service usage is quite simple. Our users can request a V2P connectivity through holding on a button; 
Then, The vehicles nearby allocated by FMS, are notified about the situation and the loaction. 
On the other side, the drivers notified decides whether to accept the request or not.
Once accepted, they become our Cardian.
